# World Database Analysis ‚Äì SQL Project

## üéØ What I Built
For my Week 3 project at the justIT Data Skills Bootcamp, I analyzed the 'world' database using SQL. I wrote a series of queries to answer specific questions, demonstrating my ability to filter, join, and rank data to extract meaningful information from a relational database.

## üí° Key Things I Learnt
- **Filtering with `WHERE`**: I learned to use the `WHERE` clause to filter data based on specific criteria, such as a region or country code.
- **Combining Conditions with `AND`**: I practiced using the `AND` operator to create more specific queries that satisfy multiple conditions at once.
- **Joining Tables with `JOIN`**: This was a key lesson. I learned how to use `JOIN` to combine rows from two different tables (`country` and `countrylanguage`) based on a related column (`CountryCode`).
- **Sorting and Limiting with `ORDER BY` and `LIMIT`**: I learned how to rank data using `ORDER BY` (in descending order) and then use `LIMIT` to select only the top results, which is essential for "Top N" analysis.

## üîç SQL Queries & Insights

Below are the specific questions from my workbook and the SQL queries I wrote to answer them.

### 1. What are the countries in the Caribbean?
This query selects all countries from the `country` table that are located in the 'Caribbean' region. (SQL query and its result, listing Caribbean countries)

### 2. What are the cities in the UK with a population over 1 million?
This query filters the `city` table for records with the CountryCode 'GBR' and a population greater than 1,000,000. (SQL query and its result, listing large UK cities)

### 3. What is the official language of each country?
This query joins the `country` and `countrylanguage` tables to match countries with their official languages. (SQL query and its result, showing countries and their official languages)

### 4. What are the 5 most populated countries in the world?
This query sorts all countries by population in descending order and returns only the top 5. (SQL query and its result, showing the top 5 most populated countries)

## üõ†Ô∏è SQL Skills Demonstrated
- `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`
- `JOIN ... ON` for combining tables
- `ORDER BY` with `DESC` for sorting
- `LIMIT` for ranking
- `AND` for multiple conditions
- Using aliases (`AS`) for clarity

## üöÄ How to Explore
1.  Download the `world db.sql` file.
2.  Import it into a MySQL database to create and populate the tables.
3.  Run any of the queries from this README to get the same results.

## üìÅ Project Files
- `world db.sql` - The SQL file to set up the database.
- `screenshots/` - The Pictures containing the result of each query.
- `README.md` - This guide.

## üéì Part of My Bootcamp Journey

## ü§î If I Had More Time
- I would use aggregate functions like `COUNT()` and `GROUP BY` to find the number of countries on each continent.
- I would write a more complex query to find the total population of all cities listed for each country.
